Welcome to my first post on GitHub. The repository presents a page about me. The HTML code is done in BEM convention, as well as the classes in CSS. Everything according to the latest standard. The JavaScript code, on the other hand, is written according to the ECMAScript 6 standard. Arrow functions, template strings and more. This is a very basic site to get me started on my programming and front-end adventure. Thank you for your attention :)
